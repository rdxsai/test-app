   - Follow-up clarifications (e.g., "can you explain more simply?", "give me an example")
   - Requests to change response style (e.g., "answer directly", "be more detailed")
   - Statements or partial answers (e.g., "I think it's for screen readers")

2. 'code_analysis_request': If the user has included a code snippet (HTML, CSS, JS) for review or has asked a question directly about a piece of code.

3. 'off_topic': ONLY if the user is asking about something completely unrelated to web accessibility AND it's not a follow-up to the current discussion (e.g., "what is the capital of France?", "tell me about cooking recipes").

IMPORTANT: If this appears to be a follow-up or continuation of the previous conversation, classify it as 'conceptual_question' even if it doesn't explicitly mention web accessibility.
