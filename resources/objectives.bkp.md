3. **Recommend** standard HTML controls whenever possible and **justify** the business and user benefits of reducing custom code for accessibility.

## I.G. Single-Page Applications (SPAs)

1. **Demonstrate** how to manage announcements of dynamic page updates (e.g., with `aria-live`) when navigation or content changes do not trigger a full page reload.
2. **Implement** focus changes appropriately when new views or dialogs appear, ensuring screen-reader and keyboard-only users can track SPA updates.

## I.H. Strategies of Persons with Disabilities in Using Web Solutions

1. **Describe** key strategies that users with blindness, low vision, motor disabilities, auditory disabilities, and cognitive/learning disabilities employ to interact with web content.
2. **Analyze** design elements (e.g., headings, landmarks, color contrast) to determine their impact on diverse user groups' navigation and comprehension strategies.
3. **Propose** layout or structural revisions (e.g., skip links, consistent navigation) that accommodate multiple disability groups.
